1. How do you handle memory management in Python, and what are some best practices for optimizing memory usage?
Memory management in Python:
I'm not sure about the details, but I know Python handles memory automatically.

2. Explain the difference between deep copy and shallow copy in Python. When would you use each?
Deep copy vs shallow copy:
I've heard these terms, but I'm not entirely clear on the difference. I'd need to look that up.

3. What are decorators in Python, and how do you implement them? Can you give an example of a practical use case?
Decorators:
I've seen the @ symbol in some Python code, but I'm not sure what it does exactly.

4. How does Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) work, and what are its implications for multi-threaded applications?
Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with this concept.

5. Describe the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. What are some key features introduced in Python 3?
Python 2 vs Python 3:
I've only used Python 3 in my projects. I know Python 2 is older, but I'm not sure of the specific differences.

6. How do you implement concurrency in Python? Compare and contrast threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio.
Concurrency in Python:
I haven't worked with this yet. Is it related to running things at the same time?

7. Explain the concept of metaclasses in Python. When and why would you use them?
Metaclasses:
I'm afraid I don't know what these are.

8. How do you handle database connections in a Python application? What are some best practices for managing database transactions?
Database connections:
I've used SQLite in a small project, but I'm not sure about best practices for managing connections.

9. What are some design patterns you commonly use in Python, and can you provide examples of how you've implemented them?
Design patterns:
I've heard this term, but I haven't knowingly used any specific design patterns in my projects yet.

10. How do you approach testing in Python? Describe your experience with unit testing, integration testing, and mocking.
Testing in Python:
I've run some basic tests using assert statements, but I haven't used any formal testing frameworks.
