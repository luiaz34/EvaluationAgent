1. How do you handle memory management in Python, and what are some best practices for optimizing memory usage?
Memory management in Python:
I know Python has automatic memory management with garbage collection. I try to be careful with large data structures and use generators when possible to save memory

2. Explain the difference between deep copy and shallow copy in Python. When would you use each?
Deep copy vs shallow copy:
Shallow copy creates a new object but references the same memory for nested objects. Deep copy creates a completely independent copy. I'd use deep copy when I need to modify nested objects without affecting the original.

3. What are decorators in Python, and how do you implement them? Can you give an example of a practical use case?
Decorators:
Decorators are functions that modify other functions. I've used them for simple logging in my projects. For example, @timer to measure function execution time.

4. How does Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) work, and what are its implications for multi-threaded applications?
Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):
I've heard of the GIL but I'm not very familiar with its workings or implications. I know it can affect multi-threaded performance in CPU-bound tasks.

5. Describe the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. What are some key features introduced in Python 3?
Python 2 vs Python 3:
I've only worked with Python 3. I know print is a function now, and there are new features like f-strings and the walrus operator.

6. How do you implement concurrency in Python? Compare and contrast threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio.
Concurrency in Python:
I've used threading for I/O-bound tasks in a web scraping project. I'm aware of multiprocessing and asyncio but haven't used them extensively.

7. Explain the concept of metaclasses in Python. When and why would you use them?
Metaclasses:
I'm not very familiar with metaclasses. I understand they're classes for classes, but I haven't used them in my projects.

8. How do you handle database connections in a Python application? What are some best practices for managing database transactions?
Database connections:
In my projects, I've used SQLite with the sqlite3 module. I always make sure to close connections after use.

9. What are some design patterns you commonly use in Python, and can you provide examples of how you've implemented them?
Design patterns:
I've implemented a simple Singleton pattern in a project to ensure only one instance of a configuration manager.

10. How do you approach testing in Python? Describe your experience with unit testing, integration testing, and mocking.
Testing in Python:
I've used unittest for some basic unit testing in my projects. I'm familiar with assert statements and test cases, but I haven't done much with integration testing or mocking.
